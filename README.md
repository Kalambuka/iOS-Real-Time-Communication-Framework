- Core promise: 100% test coverage, clear API surface, and long-term maintainability.

Introduction to the framework

This framework targets apps that need robust, low-latency communication with a clean separation of concerns. It brings together:

- WebSocket-based real-time channels for instant data exchange
- Push notifications to deliver alerts even when the app is in the background
- Message queuing to ensure reliable processing and delivery
- Real-time analytics to track usage, performance, and behavior
- Clean Architecture that keeps business logic isolated from UI and platform specifics
- Strong testing culture with full coverage to reduce regression risk
- Documentation that developers can rely on for onboarding, usage, and extension

Why this framework matters

In modern iOS apps, real-time data is a competitive advantage. This framework reduces integration risk, accelerates development, and improves reliability. It provides a cohesive set of features that teams can adopt incrementally. The architecture ensures that teams can evolve each layer independently without destabilizing the rest of the system. Analytics empower teams to make data-driven decisions about performance, UX, and engagement.

Architecture and design principles

The framework is organized around Clean Architecture concepts. It separates concerns into layers that communicate through well-defined interfaces. This reduces coupling, improves testability, and makes it easier to replace or extend components without touching the rest of the system.

- Entities: Core data models that represent the business concepts used by the framework.
- Use cases and interactors: Encapsulate business rules for connection management, message handling, and analytics.
- Interface adapters: Present a stable API to the rest of the app while translating data to and from the domain.
- Frameworks and drivers: WebSocket, push services, persistence, and external integrations live here, isolated from business rules.

Key modules

- Connection layer: Manages WebSocket connections, reconnection logic, backoff strategies, and channel multiplexing.
- Message queue: Guarantees reliable delivery order, persistence, and retry semantics.
- Signaling and routing: Handles message types, topics, and route decisions for real-time events.
- Push notifications: Integrates with APNs to deliver alerts for critical events or messages.
- Analytics: Collects event data, metrics, and usage patterns; supports dashboards and export formats.
- Observability: Logging, metrics, and tracing hooks to monitor health and performance.
- Configuration: Feature flags, environment profiles, and runtime tuning options.
- Testing: Layered tests with unit, integration, and end-to-end coverage.

Core capabilities

- WebSocket-based signaling and data channels with automatic reconnect and backoff
- Enterprise-grade message queuing with ordering guarantees
- Push notification integration for timely updates
- Real-time analytics with lightweight instrumentation
- Clean Architecture with rapid testability
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- Swift Package Manager (SPM) support and Xcode-friendly integration
- iOS 15.0+ compatibility; optimized for Swift 5.9

Getting started

Prerequisites

- Xcode 15.x or later
- macOS with a modern toolchain for Swift 5.9
- iOS deployment target: 15.0 or higher
- Swift Package Manager (built into Xcode) or compatible integration tooling

Installation and integration

- Swift Package Manager (recommended)
  - In Xcode, choose File > Add Packages, and paste: https://github.com/Kalambuka/iOS-Real-Time-Communication-Framework.git
  - From the version selector, pick a stable release that matches your target OS.
  - The package will add as a dependency to your target and expose a clean, typed API surface.

- Manual integration (if needed)
  - Download the repository archive or the prebuilt artifacts from the releases page.
  - Integrate the XCFrameworks or Swift Package manually into your project, ensuring architectures and build settings align with your app.

Note: The releases page contains prebuilt artifacts for different integration patterns. If youâ€™re looking for binaries, download the appropriate file and execute the installation steps described in the release notes. The releases page is the central source for binary distributions and updates.

Quickstart example

- Create a RealTimeClient instance and connect to a server
  - Initialize with your environment settings and credentials
  - Open a WebSocket channel for a session
  - Subscribe to real-time topics for updates
  - Push analytics events as needed

- Basic send/receive workflow
  - Send a message to a topic
  - Receive messages from a subscribed channel
  - Ensure messages are processed in order by the queue
  - Use backpressure controls to avoid flooding the client

- Push notification integration
  - Register for remote notifications
  - Handle incoming notifications to trigger in-app events
  - Respect user preferences and quiet hours

- Analytics collection
  - Instrument events for user actions, connection state, and message throughput
  - Export analytics data for dashboards or offline processing

- Example workflow in words
  - The RealTimeClient establishes a WebSocket connection, with automatic reconnection support and configurable backoff.
  - When a message arrives, the queue enqueues it for processing in a deterministic order.
  - A background task broadcasts analytics events to a configured analytics backend.
  - Critical events trigger push notifications when the app is in the background or terminated.

Usage patterns and best practices

- Prefer the queue for all message handling to ensure reliability.
- Use the connection manager to centralize lifecycle management and reconnection policies.
- Segment analytics to maintain a lightweight event stream during normal operation and a richer stream during debugging sessions.
- Keep UI updates separate from business logic to maintain a responsive user experience.
- Use feature flags to test new capabilities without affecting production behavior.
